# Scheme Tracker

Scheme Tracker is designed to monitor the progress of schemes, which can be domestic (e.g. around the house
such as Replacement of Kitchen Taps) or commercial (e.g. School having a new sports hall).  Schemes can be created or edited as well
as being viewed.

## UX

As a user, I want to perform an action so that I can perform a goal.

I want to edit a scheme in order to update my progress for example.

I want to obtain a scheme in the place that I live in for my home or business.

Wireframes are supplied in the wireframes folder.  Documentation (narrative and presentation) is supplied in the documentation folder.
